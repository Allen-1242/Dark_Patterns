Dark Patterns is a browser extension that identifies deceptive design elements on websites. It works by analyzing the page's DOM and using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-based LLM to determine whether a dark pattern is present. When detected, the extension highlights potentially harmful links directly on the webpage.

You can install it on Chrome or Firefox.
Please note: the backend is currently hosted on a personal server, so connections may occasionally be intermittent as I work out long-term hosting and funding.

This project is currently in development.
